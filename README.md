## Abstract
Object detecting is attracting interest of many researchers and deep learning engineers nowadays because of its wide-spread applications. In our project, we are attempting to apply state-of-the-art models in deep learning these days, including accuracy-impoved models and lightweight models for object detection on VOC-2012 dataset. 
## Task members
The details of proposed models as well as the tasks of corresponding members in our group are as follow:
1. Accuracy-improved models:
- Dao Van Tung: Faster R-CNN
- Bui Thanh Tung: SSD
- Pham Vu Huyen Trang: YOLO
- Le Duc Anh Tuan: DERT
2. Lightweight model:
- Nguyen Nho Trung: EfficientDet
